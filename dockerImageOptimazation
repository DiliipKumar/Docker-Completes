Reducing Docker image size is crucial for faster deployments and efficient resource usage. Here are 4 proven techniques to achieve a lean Docker image:

1️⃣ 𝗦𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗗𝗲𝗽𝗲𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗶𝗲𝘀 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗗𝗲𝘃 & 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗱:
Install only production dependencies in the final image.
Use commands like npm install --only=production or pip install --no-dev to differentiate between dev and prod dependencies.

2️⃣ 𝗔𝗹𝗽𝗶𝗻𝗲 𝗕𝗮𝘀𝗲 𝗜𝗺𝗮𝗴𝗲:
Alpine is a minimal base image that drastically reduces the image size.
Ensure compatibility with Alpine, as it has a smaller package ecosystem and may need additional installations.

3️⃣ 𝗠𝘂𝗹𝘁𝗶-𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗴𝗲 𝗕𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱𝘀:
Multi-stage builds allow you to build your app in one stage and copy only the necessary artifacts to the final image, ensuring it contains only production-ready code.

4️⃣ 𝗡𝗴𝗶𝗻𝘅 𝗮𝘀 𝗮 𝗪𝗲𝗯 𝗦𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗲𝗿:
Use a lightweight Nginx base image to efficiently serve static files for web apps. It’s minimal and optimized for performance.

💡 By applying these techniques, you can reduce Docker images from GBs to MBs, optimizing performance and speeding up deployments!
